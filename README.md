### A collection of all those small projects that don't warrant their own repository.

# sleep

Sleep sort script, input is integers separated by spaces.

# window-closer

Takes the title of a currently open window as input and closes it.

# hotkey

You can write your own Python script and execute it using a key sequence.

# random-file

Generates a random file with set number of random 0s and 1s. It's very very inefficient, but let's be honest, I didn't make this one to be useful to anyone.

# despacito

Starts playing Despacito on YouTube whenever a previously running process is closed.

# meme_generator

One of the many custom-made extensions for my private Discord bot. What it does it takes a standard meme template with x amount of panels, and puts parts of the passed string in their respective panels.

# xbox-music-controller

A small script that lets you control media applications with your XBOX 360 or XBOX One controller. It does so by mapping the multimedia buttons to the controller's buttons.
